ServiceConsumer
	This is a C# class library which exposes a method
which calls the web service. This method is called from a
C++ wrapper, which allows the web service, a C# application, 
to be called by the KSP, a C application. C is unmanaged code
and C# is managed code, so it can't be called directly.
